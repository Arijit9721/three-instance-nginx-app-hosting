## Overview

  

LifeTracker is a fun web app built with **HTML, CSS,** and **JavaScript** that takes the user's date of birth and generates a random future date labeled as their "death date." This is purely for entertainment purposes and does not predict actual events.

  

## Features

  

 ✅ Takes user input for day, month, and year of birth.

 ✅ Validates the entered date to ensure correctness.

 ✅ Generates a random future date between 1 to 50 years ahead.

 ✅ Displays the generated date dynamically on the webpage.

 ✅ Clears input fields on page reload.

  

## How It Works

  

1.  The user enters their date of birth.

  

2.  The app validates the entered date.

  

3.  A random future date (1 to 100 years ahead) is generated.

  

4. The generated date is displayed as the user's "death date."

## Technologies Used

  

**HTML:** Structure of the webpage

  

**CSS:** Styling and layout

  

**JavaScript:** Core logic and event handling

  

## Code Breakdown

  

### Input Validation

  

- The app ensures that only valid dates are accepted.

  

- Handles cases like leading zeros and invalid dates.

  

### Random Date Generation

  

- Converts the input date into milliseconds.

  

- Generates a random number of days (between 1-50 years).

  

- Converts the generated milliseconds back into a date format.

  

## Example Output

  

If the user enters **01/01/2000**, the app may generate a date like:

  

		23 / 06 / 2045
